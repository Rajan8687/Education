            <p class="sectiontag">Education System in nepal</p>
            <p class="sectiontagsub">Education in Nepal was long based on home-schooling and gurukulas.[1] The first
                formal
                school (Durbar School), established by Jung Bahadur Rana in 1853, was intended for the elite. The birth
                of
                Nepalese democracy in 1951 opened its classrooms to a more diverse population.[1] Education in Nepal
                from
                the primary school to the university level has been modeled from the very inception on the Indian
                system,
                which is in turn the legacy of the old British Raj.[2]

                Nepal's 1971 education plan hastened its development in the country.[1] In 1951 Nepal had 10,000
                students in
                300 schools and an adult literacy rate of five percent.[1] There were 49,000 schools in 2010,[1] and by
                2015
                the overall adult literacy rate was 63.9 percent (males 76.4 percent and females 53.1 percent).[3] It
                has
                already been more than half decade that public schools started imparting the education in the country.
                Curriculum developed in the country is not oriented towards the practical education. Public schools are
                criticized for not being able to provide quality education. Lower-caste discrimination, and indigenous
                bias
                are now the primary barriers to equitable access to education. After thorough review of secondary
                literature, analysis through macro perspective under the influence of critical pedagogy, the following
                problems were identified: lack of physical and infrastructures, textbooks, a unified national
                curriculum,
                monolingual instruction, and a lack of constructive and critical pedagogical strategies. Furthermore,
                poverty and social exclusion are the major factors contributing to poor performance.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag">Structure</p>
            <p class="sectiontagsub">Primary education in Nepal called Basic Education consists of grades one through
                eight. Secondary levels are grades nine to twelve. Pre-primary education is available in some areas, and
                students usually begin grade one at age five. A Basic Level Examination (BLE), previously known as
                District Level Examination (DLE), is given on grade eight while a national Secondary Education Exam
                (SEE), previously known as School Leaving Certificate (SLC), is examination is conducted at the end of
                grade 10, while completing the Grade 12 examination leads to the School Leaver's Certificate. The
                National Examinations Board (NEB) supervises all BLE, SEE and 12th grade exams.

                University education leads successfully to the degrees of bachelor, master and doctor (Ph.D). Depending
                upon the educational stream and degree subject, a bachelor's degree may require as much as three to five
                years of study, but two years is the typical duration. Some universities offer M.Phil. and post-graduate
                diplomas.

                Vocational education begins after lower secondary education, and students can follow a two-year
                curriculum leading to a Technical School Leaving Certificate.[5] Universities also offer professional
                and technical degrees. In addition to the formal track, one-year programs focusing on skills development
                are also available.[5] The District Level Examination is given in grade eight. The new educational
                system has two levels: basic (grades one through eight) and secondary (grades nine through twelve).</p>

            <p class="sectiontag">Administration</p>
            <p class="sectiontagsub">The Ministry of Education is responsible for managing educational activities in
                Nepal. The Minister of Education (assisted by the state or assistant minister) is the political leader
                of the ministry. The ministry, as a part of the government, is headed by the Secretary of Education and
                consists of a central national office and other offices at the regional and district levels. The central
                office is primarily responsible for policy development, planning, monitoring, and evaluation.

                The ministry has established directorates in each of the five development regions and education offices
                in each of Nepal's 76 districts to bring educational administration to the people. These decentralized
                offices are responsible for overseeing local informal and school-level educational activities. Regional
                directorates are primarily responsible for coordinating, monitoring and evaluating educational
                activities, and the district education offices provide services.

                The National Center for Educational Development (NCED) [4] is Nepal's teacher-training body. It has 34
                educational training centers (ETCs) to provide pedagogical support for teachers.

                Nepal has two primary types of schools: community and institutional. Community (public) schools receive
                government grants, and institutional (private) schools are self-funded. Institutional schools are
                non-profit trusts or companies.

                With one exception, all universities and academies are publicly managed and supported by public funding.
                Public universities also provide affiliation to private colleges. Academies of higher education are
                typically single-college institutes, and universities have constituent and affiliated colleges across
                Nepal.</p>
